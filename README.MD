# Fixture

**Fixture** is a no-bullshit, it is a free and open source raster graphics editor.

## Motivation

**Fixture** is an attempt to be a multiplatform, free and open source replacement for Adobe Photoshop. This aims to solve the need for having a proper raster graphics editor with a clean and focused UI, to help graphic artists and regular users morph or create images quickly, even on a Linux distribution. Lets give boost up to OpenSource Community and make the life easy.

## Installation

Fixture, as of now is a work in progress. The master branch has the latest compilable but not necessary the most stable version. To grab a copy of Fixture, simply clone the repository.

`git clone https://github.com/eyeon/Fixture.git `

Install the latest version of Qt Creator from [here](https://www.qt.io/download).
You can then open the `Fixture.pro` file with Qt Creator and compile the program to an executable. You can find more info [here](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-building-running.html).
